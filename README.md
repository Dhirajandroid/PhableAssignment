## Problem Statement

#### Create an application where you will have 2 fragments inside an activity. The application should perform following activities:

 

1) First fragment should have a recyclerview with a floatingactionbutton.

2) The second fragment should have 2 edittexts and one button. First edittext should contain name and second should contain email id.

3) In first fragment every cardview should contain name and email id of the user.

4) When you click on any cardview, you should get an alert which will have 2 options to either delete the cardview or update the data present in it.

5) when you click on delete, that particular cardview should be deleted.

6) when you click on update, it should redirect you to the second fragment which will have pre filled data of the same user.

7) if I update data in the second fragment's edittexts and press submit, it should be redirected to the first fragment and that particular user's data should be updated.

8) when you click on the floating action button in the first fragment, you should be redirected to the second fragment where you should be able to add a user. After pressing submit, you should be redirected to the first fragment and in the first fragment the data should be added in a recycle review.
